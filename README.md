# Forestopia
# 🌲 Sustainability Forest Web App (PHP)

This web application is a detailed simulation and analysis tool for forest sustainability, built using **PHP**. It allows users to model forest growth, cutting regimes, and production outcomes over a 30-year span. Designed for environmental and forestry management studies, the system provides predictive insights into tree growth, production yield, and sustainability based on various cutting regimes.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was developed to simulate a **realistic forest management system**, offering long-term forecasting of forest behavior based on different cutting strategies. It supports sustainability efforts through data-driven analysis and visualization.

---

## 🌲 Core Features

### 🧮 Forest Generation & Simulation
- Simulate and generate **50,000 trees**
- Visualize forest at:
  - **Year 0** (initial state)
  - **Year 30** (after cutting, predicted mortality, victims, and growth)

---

### 📊 Regime-Based Analysis

Supports simulation for cutting regimes:
- **Regime 45**
- **Regime 50**
- **Regime 55**
- **Regime 60**

For each regime:
- View **list of trees** (Year 0 & Year 30)
- View **stand tables**
- Analyze **production data** (Year 0 & Year 30)
- View **damage data**
- See **final output summary**:
  - Production at Year 0
  - Damage analysis
  - Growth analysis at Year 30
  - Production at Year 30

---

### 📈 Data Visualization

Includes advanced visualization tools:
- 🌳 **Tree Plotting** – spatial layout of trees
- 📊 **Bar Charts** showing:
  - Volume & tree count
  - Growth analysis
  - Best regime for sustainability and production

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **PHP** (Core backend logic)
- **HTML/CSS/JS** (Frontend)
- **MySQL** (Database – optional if you're storing simulations)
- **Chart.js / Google Charts / D3.js** *(for data visualization)*

---

## 💡 Potential Use Cases

- Forestry education and learning tools
- Decision support system for sustainable forest management
- Research on long-term effects of different cutting regimes
